  During my tenure at Wibmo Inc., I was trained extensively in Java and the SpringBoot framework, enabling me 
  to integrate a Keycloak authentication system. This resulted in a streamlined single sign-on (SSO) process for users, 
  reducing login time by 50%. I also developed and deployed high-performance REST APIs using SpringBoot and Java, 
  leading to a 30% increase in API response time. Through thorough unit and functional testing using ZeroCode, 
  I achieved a 98% test coverage, reducing the number of bugs found during user acceptance testing by 60%.
